## Virtual machine setup

All the assignment can be done in the Ubuntu 24.04 VM.
We need virtual machines because courseworks will rely on Linux kernel features
and external tools that rely on those features.
We also need root privilege.

### Linux, Windows and Intel Mac

Install Virtualbox
(Windows users should also install Git for Windows).

### ARM Mac

Use [Lima](https://lima-vm.io/)
```
